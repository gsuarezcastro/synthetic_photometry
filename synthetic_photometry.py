	'''
	Compute synthetic magnitudes and fluxes from spectra for different filters

	Returns
	------
	out_synthetic_photometry: python dictionary with the following parameters for each filter
		out_synthetic_photometry['lambda_eff(um)']: effective wavelength in micron
		out_synthetic_photometry['width_eff(um)']: effective width in micron
		out_synthetic_photometry['syn_flux(erg/s/cm2/A)']: synthetic flux in erg/s/cm2/A
		out_synthetic_photometry['esyn_flux(erg/s/cm2/A)']: synthetic flux errors in erg/s/cm2/A (if input flux errors are provided)

	Example
	>>> import synthetic_photometry as synthetic_photometry 
	>>> # assume we have a spectrum wavelength (wl in um), flux (in erg/s/cm2/A), and flux error (eflux) and we want synthetic photometry for several filters
	>>> filters = (['Spitzer/IRAC.I1', 'WISE/WISE.W1']) # filters of interest
	>>>	# run the code
	>>> out_synthetic_photometry = synthetic_photometry.synthetic_photometry(wl=wl, flux=flux, eflux=eflux, flux_unit='erg/s/cm2/A', filters=filters)
	>>> # output
	>>> eff_wl = out_synthetic_photometry['lambda_eff(um)'] # effective wavelength (um) for all filters
	>>> eff_width = out_synthetic_photometry['width_eff(um)'] # effective width (um) for all filters
	>>> flux_syn = out_synthetic_photometry['syn_flux(erg/s/cm2/A)'] # synthetic flux (erg/s/cm2/A) for all filters
	>>> eflux_syn = out_synthetic_photometry['esyn_flux(erg/s/cm2/A)'] # synthetic flux errors (erg/s/cm2/A) for all filters
	>>> flux_Jy_syn = out_synthetic_photometry['syn_flux(Jy)'] # synthetic flux (Jy) for all filters
	>>> eflux_Jy_syn = out_synthetic_photometry['esyn_flux(Jy)'] # synthetic flux errors (Jy) for all filters
	>>> mag_syn = out_synthetic_photometry['syn_mag'] # synthetic magnitude for all filters
	>>> emag_syn = out_synthetic_photometry['esyn_mag'] # synthetic magnitude error for all filters

		2024/05/09	included VOTable table with all SVO filter zero points
		2024/05/07	filter transmissions are read and downloaded from SVO, if not already stored locally
		2024/04/20	function created
		2021      	functional code not as a function
